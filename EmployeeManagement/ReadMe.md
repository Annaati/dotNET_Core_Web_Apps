 This is System is/was my first try in **ASP.NET Core MVC**. Its by [_Kudvenkat_](https://github.com/Annaati/dotNET_Core_Web_Apps) an entire Played on his [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Csharp-video-tutorialsBlogspot) published on through December _2018 to November 2019_ and there aren't that much Customzation to the Original System even though I did some. He is by far one of the best Instructors and when it comes to dotNET Stuff, his Courses rank top even those from 2013 or so.

 I begun this Project on **May 2022**. at the time the latest dotNET Version was dotNET 6 with C# 11 which were released on at the same time alongside Visual Studio 2022. I Chose this spefic old version(2.2) beacuse of this Course which was based on this version. There were a lot of new courses specially on the popular version _3.1_ but KudVenkats Explaination and Teaching style were second to none.
